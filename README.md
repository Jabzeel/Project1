# Project1

This project is just an example.

Its function is to adquire basic data from an user and display it fully in a new page. 

There are some required data marked with an asterisk (*), if this data is not given then the user can't go to the next page.

All data is saved in every page, so the user can go back to a specific page and replace the information that has already being inserted.
